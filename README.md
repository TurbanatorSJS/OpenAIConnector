# OpenAI Connector

This project demonstrates how to interact with the OpenAI API to utilize the powerful GPT-3.5 Turbo model for text completions.

## Description

The OpenAI Connector project provides a Python script that makes use of the OpenAI API to generate completions based on given prompts. In this case, it showcases how to instruct the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

## Requirements

To run this script, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- The `requests` library
  
  ```
  pip3 install requests
  ```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenAI-Connector.git
cd OpenAI-Connector
```
2. Get your API key:
To use the OpenAI API, you need an API key. Visit the OpenAI website (https://openai.com) and sign up for an account if you don't have one. Once logged in, you can find your API key in your account settings.

3. Replace your API key in your code.

4. Run the script:
```
python openaiAutomator.py
```
The script will send a prompt to the GPT-3.5 Turbo model via the OpenAI API.

Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes and serves as an example of how to use the OpenAI API with Python Request Module. Make sure to review the OpenAI API documentation and comply with their usage policies.
